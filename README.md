# DAHCC HeartRate Dataset

This dataset repository is a small part of the [DAHCC](https://dahcc.idlab.ugent.be/) dataset.
We used the feather files available [here](https://dahcc.idlab.ugent.be/dataset.html) to create the dataset.
We mapped the heart rate data from the feather files to an RDF file using the
[feather-rdf-mapper](https://github.com/argahsuknesib/feather-RDF-mapper) repository.

Here you can find 4 datasets for 4 different patient participants.
